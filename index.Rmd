# Introduction
\superscript^*__Contribution Statement:__*^
\superscript^*All three members attempted and completed the online tutorials for Assignments 4 and 5. We each crafted the maps independently and collectively determined which maps to include for the final deliverable. We aided each other in moments of troubleshooting and collaborated to create maps. Each of us were assigned the city of Chelsea for our studio projects, so this investigation was created and used, in part, in studio presentations. 10 points for all.*^

Your portfolio should demonstrate each of the following skills (not all of which are demonstrated in this example):

* Displaying multiple vector layers on the same map
* Calculating and displaying relationships among point and polygon layers based on distance
* Aggregating point data to a layer of polygons
* Calculating and displaying accessibility, based on travel time
* Converting between raster layers and vector layers
* Displaying raster data on a map
* Georeferencing a raster image
* Displaying data on an interactive map






# **MIDDLESEX COUNTY, MA**
Here are two maps of Chelsea. I might include some text here about this set of maps.

## **Interactive Map**
This interactive map demonstrates the following skills: 

* Displaying data on an interactive map

# **CHELSEA**
Here are two maps of Chelsea. I might include some text here about this set of maps.

## **Isochrones**
This map shows isochrones based on transit travel times to the nearest school. It demonstrates the following skills:

* Displaying multiple vector layers on the same map
* Calculating and displaying accessibility, based on travel time

## **Accessibility**
This map shows accessibility based on a distance-decay function of the walking time to the nearest transit stop. It demonstrates the following skills:

* Displaying multiple vector layers on the same map
* Calculating and displaying accessibility, based on travel time
* Displaying raster data on a map

# **VENICE, ITALY**
Here are two maps of Chelsea. I might include some text here about this set of maps.

## **Clockboard Map**
This map demonstrates the following skills:

* Aggregating point data to a layer of polygons

# Maps of San Luis Obispo
Here are two maps of San Luis Obispo, California. I might include some text here as well.
